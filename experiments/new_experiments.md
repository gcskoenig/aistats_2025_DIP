# New Experiments

We applied the method on two more complex datasets: The "Online news popularity" dataset (d=62, n=39797, https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/332/online+news+popularity) and the "Superconductivity" dataset (d=81, n=21263, https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/464/superconductivty+data). 

The scripts to reproduce the experiments as well as the results can be found in the subfolders `superconductivity/` ([link](https://anonymous.4open.science/r/aistats_2025_DIP-82A3/experiments/superconductivity/superconductivity_loo_10fold_10.pdf)) and `online-news/` ([link](https://anonymous.4open.science/r/aistats_2025_DIP-82A3/experiments/online-news/popularity_loo_10fold_10.pdf)).
